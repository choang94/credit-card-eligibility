# credit_card_eligibility

This project is to explore and create predictive models for the Credit Card Eligibility Determining Factor dataset on Kaggle. Please find the data dictionary and more information [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohit265/credit-card-eligibility-data-determining-factors/data).

Under `lib`, I have source code of functions that I used in the notebooks
Under `notebooks`, I have the dataset in csv format and a notebook for EDA and a notebook for modeling.
